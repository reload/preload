# STARTERTHEME theme

# TODO
This theme was started from the starter theme in Reload\!s start-platform. To start using this theme do these steps:

 * Replace logo.png with ont that makes sense for your theme.
 * Replace the favicon - unless you are Simon.
 * Replace the screenshot.png file.

## Set up
If you don't have Grunt installed, then go follow the [Getting started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide.

To build the theme, cd to the theme directory and run `npm install`.

## Usage
To start Grunt, run `grunt` in the theme directory. Now the css will be compiled into a *.css file and a *.css.map file.
The *.css.map files will give you browser support for SASS.
