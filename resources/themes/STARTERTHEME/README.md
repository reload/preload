# STARTERTHEME theme
This theme was generated by the [pReload](github.com/reload/preload) script.


## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)


## Installation
This theme comes with a premade `composer.json` and `Gruntfile.js` file. These files are setup to run Libsass and Bourbon, so there is no dependencies for globally installed SASS or Compass gems. â€“ You simply have to install the node packages:

`npm install`



## Usage
To get started, you only have to run the `grunt` command. This will watch your SASS files and compile them to `THEMENAME.*.css` and `THEMENAME.*.css.map` files.

`grunt`


## Recommendations
* Replace logo.png with one that makes sense for your theme.
* Replace the favicon.
* Replace the screenshot.png file.
